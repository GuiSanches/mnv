## Mnv - A web interface for large scale networks

### About

This is a framework for interacting and building large scale network driven applications. This version provides a guide for adding multiple features following DDD (Domain driven development) practices to scalate and increase the use cases and scenarios provided by this application.

The application can be tested at [vercel](https://mnv.vercel.app) the features currently developed are:
  - Loading default networks
  - Load multiple networks at the same tab
  - Grid visualization
  - Topography informations
  - A lot of mouse driven interactions
  - Multilevel algorithms integration to compress large scale networks
  
  This project is better descripted at the article [Desenvolvimento de uma arquitetura limpa aplicada em um sistema
web multinível](https://www.overleaf.com/read/nrjtfxjvxkvt) as part of a final paper for bachelor in Information Systems at ICMC (USP - University of São Paulo).
